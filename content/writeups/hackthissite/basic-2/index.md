**Description:**

Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file & compare it to the password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the password file…

**Requirements:** Common sense.

**Hints:**

- Read the description carefully.
- If the password file is missing, what is the password you submit being compared to?

**Difficulty:** Easy.

**Points:** 10

**Challenge Link:** https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/2

**Forum Link:**

**Solution:**

As we can see in the description that the password file was not uploaded so just submitting the NULL (empty) password will do the trick.

Happy Hacking
