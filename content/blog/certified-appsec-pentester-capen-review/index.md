### Tips & Tricks

- Ensure all necessary tools are preconfigured:
	- [sslyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze) - for SSL/TLS scanning.
	- Burp Suite or any other proxy tool of your choice.
	- Python or any scripting language you prefer.
	- [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) - an automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool.
	- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) - for accessing S3 buckets.
	- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/) - for connecting to the exam VPN.
- For OSINT-related challenges, search for the same username as the target or variations of it on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Pastebin.
- Avoid trying to obtain a reverse shell. You will be provided with the file path where the flag is located, so read the flag directly. This will save you time.
- When you start the exam, the VPN may take some time to take effect. First, go through all the questions and take mental notes. Sometimes, one question can help solve another.
- Keep your notes handy or utilize online resources like [Payloads All The Things](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/PayloadsAllTheThings/) and [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/pentesting-web/web-vulnerabilities-methodology.html).
- Some vulnerabilities may require multi-step exploitation. Learn how to automate this process.

### My Thoughts on the Exam

The exam consists of 17 true/false, yes/no, multiple-choice, and CTF-type questions. Each question is allocated an appropriate score based on its level of difficulty.

In my opinion, the overall difficulty level was easy, not intermediate. However, each person's experience may vary.

The questions are very specific regarding the type of vulnerability class you will be exploiting, which makes the exam easier.

I have observed that the exam lacks dynamic questions. The questions and flags remain the same in every attempt. In my opinion, this is a significant drawback. If the exam questions are leaked, it would undermine the exam's credibility and reduce its value.
